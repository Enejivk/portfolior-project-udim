"""
This module defines Marshmallow schemas for serializing and deserializing User 
objects. It includes validation for first name, last name, and email fields, 
as well as a nested schema for payments related to the user.

Classes:
    UserSchema: A schema for serializing and deserializing User objects. 
        Attributes:
            first_name (String): The first name of the user. It is required 
                and must be at least 3 characters long.
            last_name (String): The last name of the user. It is required 
                and must be at least 3 characters long.
            email (String): The email of the user. It is required and must be 
                a valid email format.
            payments (Nested): A nested schema for payments related to the user.
        Methods:
            validate_email(data, **kwargs): Validates that the email is unique 
                in the User table.
    UserCreateSchema: A schema for serializing and deserializing User objects 
        specifically for user creation. It extends the UserSchema by adding a 
        required password field.
        Attributes:
            password (String): The password of the user. It is required.
        Methods:
            None

Attributes:
    user_schema (UserSchema): An instance of UserSchema.
    user_create_schema (UserCreateSchema): An instance of UserCreateSchema.
