This module defines the GroupSchema for serializing and deserializing Group 
objects using Marshmallow. It includes validation for the group name and 
nested schemas for payments and members.

Classes:
    GroupSchema: A Marshmallow schema for Group objects.

Attributes:
    name (String): The name of the group. It is required and must be at least 
        3 characters long.
    payments (Nested): A nested schema for payments related to the group.
    members (Nested): A nested schema for members related to the group.

Methods:
    validate_name(data, **kwargs): Validates that the group name is unique in 
        the Group table.
